# Fuzzy-logic-controller

A prototype fuzzy logic controller API based on a control engineering perspective, focusing on simplicity, versatility, and application independency.

This simple API provides a general template-based class, that can be defined to control any system with minimal limitations.

The API code is fully contained in the header file "FuzzyController.h", and an example of the API for controlling an inverted pendulum on a cart is included in the CPP file "FuzzyController.cpp".
